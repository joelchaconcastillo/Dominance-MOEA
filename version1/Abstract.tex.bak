Most state-of-the-art Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) promote the preservation of the diversity 
in the objective space, whereas the information about the diversity in the decision variables is almost neglected.
%
%However, in the case of single-objective optimization, it has been shown that explicitly managing the diversity in the decision
%variables usually leads to higher quality solutions.
%
In this paper, the Variable-Space-Diversity based MOEA (VSD-MOEA) is presented.
%
The VSD-MOEA is a dominance-based MOEA that considers explictitly the diversity in the decision variables and the objective space.
%
Simultaneously, it uses the information of both spaces allowing to properly adapt the balance between exploration, and intensification.
%
Particularly, at the initial stages, the decisions bear in maind by the approach are more biased by the information of the diversity in the decision
variables, whereas in the last stages decisions are based on the information of the objective space.
%
The latter is achieved through a sophisticated density estimator.
%
The new method is compared with state-of-art MOEAs using several benchmarks.
%
Based on several empirical analyzes, it can be stablished that the novel proposal attains quite better results showing a more stable and robust behavior.
