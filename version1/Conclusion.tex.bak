The evolutionary algorithms have been a most popular approaches to deal with complex optimization problems.
%
Given that the quality of the \MOEAS{} is directly measured in the objective space, the majority of them incorporate sophisticated mechanisms with the aim to attain diverse and converged solutions to the Pareto Front.
%
Since this, the diversity in the decision variables tend to be neglected.
%
However, equivalently than in single-objective problems, where the diversity in variable space has a critical role, the multi-objective problems should take into consideration the diversity in both spaces to avoid premature convergence in sub-optimal regions.
%

In this work we have provided an algorithm with a particular replacement phase.
%
This phase considers the diversity in both spaces, specifically in the variable space the diversity is based in a decremental dynamic concept.
%
Thus, at the first stages the diversity in variables space is promoted, as the generations elapses this diversity is gradually reduced, thus at the last stages the replacement phase works as a classic \MOEA{}.
%

In addition, is suggested a novel density estimator of the objective space, which is based in the IGD+ indicator being consdered as weakly Pareto compliant.
%
In the experimental validation carried out, is showed that our proposal not only improves the state-of-the-art-\MOEAS{} in long-term execution, also offers a reasonable performance in short-term executions.
%
This validation shows that the VSD-MOEA is able to properly solve several test problems, also it attained better results than the remaining \MOEAS{} in the problems with the most difficult characteristics.
%
In addition, some scalability experiments with the decision variables are carry out through long-term executions, results indicate the superiority and stability mesured with the hypervolume indicator.

Therefore, is shown the relevance in having a properly managment of the diversity in the variable space, and established a way to preserve the quality and diversity in both decision and objective space.


In future, we plan to develop an adaptive scheme to avoid setting the initial factor distance, even though the \VSDMOEA{} is not highly sensitive to this parameter adapting this parameter could result in a most robust \MOEA{}.
%
In addition, a multi-objective memetic algorithm with this principle should be proposed, since that this approach managments the diversity a local serch should provedes even better results.
