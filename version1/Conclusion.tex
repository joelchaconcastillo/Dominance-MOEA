The evolutionary algorithms have been a most popular approaches to deal with complex optimization problems.
%
Particularly, the MOEAs works with different principles where the objective space is involved.
%
As it is seen in single-objective the diversity provides quality solutions specifically in complex problems.
%

In this work we have provided an algorithm with a particular replacement phase.
%
This phase considers the diversity in both spaces, specifically in the variable space the diversity is based in a decremental dynamic concept.
%
Thus, in the first stages the diversity in variables space is induced, and in a gradual way the last stages the replacement phase works as is usual.
%

Additionally a improvement distance is suggested, which is based in the IGD+ indicator and is considered as weakly Pareto compliant.
%

The experimental validation is carried out with long-term executions and the three popular benchmarks.
%
This validation shows that the VSD-MOEA is able to properly solve overall test problems, also in the most complex test instances shows the best hypervolume values.
%

In addition, some scalability experiments with the decision variables are carry out through long-term executions, results indicate the superiority and stability provided with the hypervolume indicator.

We show the relevance of diversity in the variable space an established a way to preserve the diversity in explicitly in variable space.
