abstract = "Abstract Differential Evolution is an efficient metaheuristic for continuous optimization that suffers from the curse of dimensionality. A large amount of experimentation has allowed researchers to find several potential weaknesses in Differential Evolution. Some of these weaknesses do not significantly affect its performance when dealing with low-dimensional problems, so the research community has not paid much attention to them. The aim of this paper is to provide a better insight into the reasons of the curse of dimensionality and to propose techniques to alleviate this problem. Two different weaknesses are revisited and schemes for dealing with them are devised. The schemes increase the diversity of trial vectors and improve on the exploration capabilities of Differential Evolution. Some important mathematical properties induced by our proposals are studied and compared against those of related schemes. Experimentation with a set of problems with up to 1000 dimensions and with several variants of Differential Evolution shows that the weaknesses analyzed significantly affect the performance of Differential Evolution when used on high-dimensional optimization problems. The gains of the proposals appear when highly exploitative schemes are used. Our proposals allow for high-quality solutions with small populations, meaning that the most significant advantages emerge when dealing with large-scale optimization problems, where the benefits of using small populations have previously been shown.

Along the way, several new concepts, paradigms and methods have emerged. Additionally, some authors have claimed that the application of multi-objective approaches might be useful even in single-objective optimization. Thus, several guidelines for solving single-objective optimization problems using multi-objective methods have been proposed.

abstract="The genetic algorithm behaviour is determined by the exploitation and exploration relationship kept throughout the run. Adaptive genetic algorithms, that dynamically adjust selected control parameters or genetic operators during the evolution have been built. Their objective is to offer the most appropriate exploration and exploitation behaviour to avoid the premature convergence problem and improve the final results. One of the adaptive approaches are the adaptive parameter setting techniques based on the use of fuzzy logic controllers, the fuzzy adaptive genetic algorithms (FAGAs). In this paper, we analyse the FAGAs in depth. First, we describe the steps for their design and present an instance, which is studied from an empirical point of view. Then, we propose a taxonomy for FAGAs, attending on the combination of two aspects: the level where the adaptation takes place and the way the Rule-Bases are obtained. Furthermore, FAGAs belonging to different groups of the taxonomy are reviewed. Finally, we identify some open issues, and summarise a few new promising research directions on the topic. From the results provided by the approaches presented in the literature and the experimental results achieved in this paper, an important conclusion is obtained: the use of fuzzy logic controllers to adapt genetic algorithm parameters may really improve the genetic algorithm performance.",

The main conclusions are as follows:                                  Any point in the objective space---no matter whether it is attainable or not, ideal or not---can be used instead of weighting coefficients to derive scalarizing functions which have minima at Pareto points only. Moreover, entire basic theory of multiobjective optimization--necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality and existence of Pareto-optimal solutions, etc.---can be developed with the help of reference objectives instead of weighting coefficients or utility (value) functions.                                                  Reference objectives are very practical means for solving a number of problems such as Pareto-optimality testing, scanning the set of Pareto-optimal solutions, computer-man interactive solving of multiobjective problems, group assessment of solutions of multiobjective optimization or cooperative game problems, or solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems.

abstract="In this paper, we propose the use of modified distance calculation in generational distance (GD) and inverted generational distance (IGD). These performance indicators evaluate the quality of an obtained solution set in comparison with a pre-specified reference point set. Both indicators are based on the distance between a solution and a reference point. The Euclidean distance in an objective space is usually used for distance calculation. Our idea is to take into account the dominance relation between a solution and a reference point when we calculate their distance. If a solution is dominated by a reference point, the Euclidean distance is used for their distance calculation with no modification. However, if they are non-dominated with each other, we calculate the minimum distance from the reference point to the dominated region by the solution. This distance can be viewed as an amount of the inferiority of the solution (i.e., the insufficiency of its objective values) in comparison with the reference point. We demonstrate using simple examples that some Pareto non-compliant results of GD and IGD are resolved by the modified distance calculation. We also show that IGD with the modified distance calculation is weakly Pareto compliant whereas the original IGD is Pareto non-compliant.",

abstract="This paper proposes an idea of using evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) to optimize scalarizing functions. We assume that a scalarizing function to be optimized has already been generated from an original multiobjective problem. Our task is to optimize the given scalarizing function. In order to efficiently search for its optimal solution without getting stuck in local optima, we generate a new multiobjective problem to which an EMO algorithm is applied. The point is to specify multiple objectives, which are similar to but different from the scalarizing function, so that the location of the optimal solution is near the center of the Pareto front of the generated multiobjective problem. The use of EMO algorithms helps escape from local optima. It also helps find a number of alternative solutions around the optimal solution. Difficulties of Pareto ranking-based EMO algorithms in the handling of many objectives are avoided by the use of similar objectives. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the performance of EMO algorithms as single-objective optimizers of scalarizing functions highly depends on the choice of multiple objectives. Based on this observation, we propose a specification method of multiple objectives for the optimization of a weighted sum fitness function. Experimental results show that our approach works very well in the search for not only a single optimal solution but also a number of good alternative solutions around the optimal solution. Next we evaluate the performance of our approach in comparison with a hybrid EMO algorithm where a single-objective fitness evaluation scheme is probabilistically used in an EMO algorithm. Then we show that our approach can be also used to optimize other scalarizing functions (e.g., those based on constraint conditions and reference solutions). Finally we show that our approach is applicable not only to scalarizing functions but also other single-objective optimization problems.",

Our approach adopts uniform design to obtain the set of weights and Kuhn-Munkres' (Hungarian) algorithm to solve the assignment problem. Differential evolution is used as our search engine, giving rise to the so-called Hungarian Differential Evolution algorithm (HDE). Our proposed approach is compared with respect to a MOEA based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and with respect to an indicator-based MOEA (the S metric selection Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithm, SMS- EMOA) using several test problems (taken from the specialized literature) having from two to ten objective functions. Our preliminary experimental results indicate that our proposed HDE outperforms MOEA/D and is competitive with respect to SMS-EMOA, but at a significantly lower computational cost.",
