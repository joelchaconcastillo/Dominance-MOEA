Most state-of-the-art Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (\MOEAS{}) promote the preservation of the diversity 
of the objective space, whereas the information about the diversity of the variable space is usually neglected.
%
In this paper, the Variable Space Diversity based MOEA (\VSDMOEA{}) is presented.
%
\VSDMOEA{} is a dominance-based MOEA that explicitly considers the diversity of the variable and objective space.
%
The information gathered on both spaces is used simultaneously with the aim of properly adapting the balance between exploration
and intensification during the optimization process.
%
Particularly, at the initial stages, decisions made by the approach are more biased by the information on the diversity of 
the variable space, whereas in the last stages, decisions are only based on the information on the objective space.
%
The latter is achieved through a novel density estimator.
%
The new method is compared with state-of-art \MOEAS{} using several benchmarks with two and three objectives.
%
This novel proposal yields much better results than state-of-the-art schemes when considering metrics of the objective space, 
exhibiting a more stable and robust behavior.
