Most state-of-the-art Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (\MOEAS{}) promote the preservation of the diversity 
in the objective space, whereas the information about the diversity in the decision variables is usually neglected.
%
In this paper, the Variable-Space-Diversity based MOEA (\VSDMOEA{}) is presented.
%
\VSDMOEA{} is a dominance-based MOEA that considers explicitly the diversity in the decision variables and the objective space.
%
The information gathered of both spaces is used simultaneously with the aim of properly adapting the balance between exploration
and intensification during the optimization process.
%
Particularly, at the initial stages, decisions taken by the approach are more biased by the information of the diversity in 
the decision variables, whereas in the last stages decisions are only based on the information of the objective space.
%
The latter is achieved through a novel density estimator.
%
The new method is compared with state-of-art \MOEAS{} using several benchmarks with two and three objectives.
%
The novel proposal attains much better results than state-of-the-art schemes, showing a more stable 
and robust behavior.
