In this sections the statistical and test results of the IGD+ are shown \cite{Joel:Inverted_Generational_Distance_Plus}.
%
Particularly, the stopping criterion was set to $250,000$ generations.
%
Table \ref{tab:StatisticsIGDP_2obj} shos the attained IGD+ for the benchmark functinos with two objectives.
%
Especifically, the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation of the IGD+ for each tested method and function is shown.
%
The last row shows the results considering all the functions together.
%
In each function, the data of the method that attained the alrgest mean is shown in bold face.
%
Additionally, all the methods that ere not statistically inferior than such method are shown in bold face.
%
Thus, the methods shown in bold face in a give problem are referred to as the winning methods.
%
Therefore, the amount of functions where each method attained best results in the problems of two objectives  are VSD-MOEA and R2-EMOA with .
