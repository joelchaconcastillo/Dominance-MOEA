In this sections the statistical and test results of the IGD+ are shown \cite{Joel:Inverted_Generational_Distance_Plus}.
%
Particularly, the stopping criterion was set to $250,000$ generations.
%
Table \ref{tab:StatisticsIGDP_2obj} shos the attained IGD+ for the benchmark functinos with two objectives.
%
Especifically, the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation of the IGD+ for each tested method and function is shown.
%
The last row shows the results considering all the functions together.
%
In each function, the data of the method that attained the alrgest mean is shown in bold face.
%
Additionally, all the methods that ere not statistically inferior than such method are shown in bold face.
%
Thus, the methods shown in bold face in a give problem are referred to as the winning methods.
%
Therefore, the amount of functions where each method attained the best results with two objectives are VSD-MOEA and R2-EMOA with 8 and 13 respectively.
%
Evenmore, the mean IGD+ of all the function attained by the VSD-MOEA is quite superior than the remaining algorithms (including the R2-EMOA).
%
In fact, the total mean of R2-EMOA ($0.060$), NSGA-II ($0.051$) and MOEA/D ($0.062$) are similar.
%
In contrast VSD-MOEA achieved a better value ($0.021$).
%
Futhermore, in the cases where VSD-MOEA loses, the difference with respect to the best methods is nor large.
%
In fact, the IGD+ attained by VSD-MOEA and by the best method was never larger than $0.05$.
%
However, all the other methods presented a deterioration larger than $0.05$ in several cases.
%
The counting of functions with deterioration larger than $0.05$ is $7$, $5$ and $8$ for MOEA/D, NSGA-II and R2-EMOA respectively.
%
Therefore, if VSD-MOEA loses in some cases, its deterioration is always small resulting in a robust behavior.

In order to have a better understading, several pair-wise statistical tests were done among each tested method in each function.
%
Similarly to the main document, the table \ref{tab:Tests_IGDP_2obj} shows statistical test for the two-objective cases.
%
The calculated data confirms that although VSD-MOEA loses in some cases, the overall numbers of wins and losses favor VSD-MOEA.
%

Tables \ref{tab:StatisticsIGDP_3obj} and \ref{tab:Tests_IGDP_3obj} shows the same information for the problems with three obejctives.
%
In this case, the superiority of VSD-MOEA is even clearer.
%
Takng into account the mean of all functions, VSD-MOEA attained much larger mean of the IGD+ in comparison to the other methods.
%
Particularly, VSD-MOEA attained the value $0.059$, whereas the second ranked algorithm (R2-EMOA) attained a value $0.093$.
%
The difference between IGD+ attained by VSD-MOEA was never larger than $0.05$.
%
However, all the other methods presented a deterioration larger than $0.05$ in at least one problem.
%
Particularly, it happened in $5$, $8$ and $7$ problems for MOEA/D, NSGA-II and R2-EMOa respectively.
%
Evemore, VSD-MOEA is notably superior than the other methods in terms of both total deterioration and wins.
%
VSD-MOEA won in $49$ pair-wise comparisons, whereas the second best ranked algorithm (R2-EMOA) won in $35$ pair-wise comparisons.
