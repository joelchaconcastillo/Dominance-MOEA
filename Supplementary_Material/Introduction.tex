In this document two sections that give supplementary material of the algorithms are presented.
%
First, to have better insight of some properties exposed by our proposal in comparison of the state-of-the-art algorithms, a brief explination of the simulation that includes them is described.
%
The video of this simulation is attached and available online.

Second, the same statistical information described in the main document and with the Modified Inverted Generational Distance (IGD+)~\cite{Joel:Inverted_Generational_Distance_Plus} is shown.
