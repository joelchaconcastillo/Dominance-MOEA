This document contains supplementary material to provide a clearer understanding of the 
specifics of \VSDMOEA{}.
%
First, a multimedia material that provides a visualization of the internal behavior
of \VSDMOEA{} in comparison to other state-of-the-art schemes is provided.
%
Additionally, some of the results described in the main document are analyzed in terms
of the Modified Inverted Generational Distance (IGD+) proposed by~\cite{Joel:Inverted_Generational_Distance_Plus}, 
with the conclusions being quite similar to those obtained in the main document with
the hypervolume.
